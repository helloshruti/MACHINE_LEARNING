**diabetes prediction**
As Per the facts given by WHO(World Health Organization), there are about 422 million people worldwide who suffer from Diabetes, according to various studies done by WHO approximately 1.5 million deaths every year are directly related to diabetes. Indirectly Diabetes patients can have blindness, Kidney failures, heart attacks, stroke, etc. due to high sugar levels or imbalanced insulin levels. There are 2 types of diabetes: Type 1 Diabetes and Type 2 Diabetes. A common misconception might appear that Type 1 diabetes leads to Type 2 diabetes but both these types are different in nature. In reality, pre-diabetes can lead to either Type 1 Diabetes or Type 2 Diabetes.

The dataset mentioned contains data that divides patients into 3 categories (0 = no Diabetes; 1 = Pre-Diabetic; 2 = Diabetic)

The algorithms applied to the dataset do not differentiate the type of diabetes the patient might or might not have, it only predicts whether the person is diabetic or not (it may be of Type 1 or Type 2).

The Dataset contains 21 features along with 253679 entries which are analyzed to make predictions. The following features are taken into consideration.  
1.	HighBP
0 = no diabetes
1 = pre-diabetes
2 = diabetes

2.	HighChol	
0 = no high BP
1 = high BP

3.	CholCheck
0 = No high cholesterol
1 = High cholesterol	

4.	BMI	
Contains numeric values

5.	Smoker

0 = (<=) 100

17.	DiffWalk
0 = no difficulty in climbing stairs
1 = difficulty in climbing stairs	

18.	Sex

1 = male

19.	Age
